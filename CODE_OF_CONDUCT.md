# Learnly Code of Conduct

Like the technical community as a whole, the Learnly team and community is made up of a mixture of professionals and volunteers from all over the world, working on every aspect of the mission — including mentorship, teaching, and connecting people.

Diversity is one of our greatest strengths, but it can also lead to communication issues and unhappiness. To that end, we have a few ground rules that we ask people to adhere to. This code applies equally to founders, mentors, and those seeking help and guidance.

This isn’t an exhaustive list of things that you can’t do. Rather, take it in the spirit in which it’s intended — a guide to make it easier to enrich all of us and the technical communities in which we participate.

This Code of Conduct applies to all spaces managed by the Learnly project or [mehedi.hridoy101@gmail.com](mailto:mehedi.hridoy101@gmail.com). This includes IRC, mailing lists, the issue tracker, DSF events, and any other forums created by the project team that the community uses for communication. In addition, violations of this code outside these spaces may affect a person's ability to participate within them.

If you believe someone is violating the Code of Conduct, we ask that you report it by emailing [hridoy15-5097@diu.edu.bd](mailto:hridoy15-5097@diu.edu.bd). For more details, please see the [Reporting Guidelines](#reporting-guidelines).

## Our Expectations

- **Be friendly and patient.**
- **Be welcoming.**  
  We strive to be a community that welcomes and supports people of all backgrounds and identities. This includes, but is not limited to, members of any race, ethnicity, culture, national origin, color, immigration status, social and economic class, educational level, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, age, size, family status, political belief, religion, and mental and physical ability.

- **Be considerate.**  
  Your work will be used by other people, and you in turn will depend on the work of others. Any decision you take will affect users and colleagues, and you should take those consequences into account. Remember that we're a worldwide community, so you might not be communicating in someone else's primary language.

- **Be respectful.**  
  Not all of us will agree all the time, but disagreement is no excuse for poor behavior. Frustration must never turn into a personal attack. A respectful environment ensures everyone can contribute meaningfully.

- **Be careful in the words that you choose.**  
  We are a community of professionals. Kindness matters. Harassment, insults, or exclusionary behavior are not acceptable. This includes, but is not limited to:  
  - Violent threats or language directed at another person  
  - Discriminatory jokes and language  
  - Posting sexually explicit or violent material  
  - Posting (or threatening to post) other people's personal information ("doxing")  
  - Personal insults, especially those based on race, gender, or other identity factors  
  - Unwelcome sexual attention  
  - Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior  
  - Repeated harassment even after being asked to stop

- **When we disagree, try to understand why.**  
  Disagreements, both social and technical, happen. Learnly is no exception. It's crucial to handle differing views with empathy. Different perspectives enrich us. Remember, it's human to err. Focus on solving problems rather than blaming.
